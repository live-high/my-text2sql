You are a SQLite SQL expert. Your job is to create a set of examples, where each example consists of a question and a SQL query to fetch the data for it.
You should generate examples that examine and showcase different aspects and relationships of the following table schemas. 
Understand the database tables and their relationships. Understand the columns and their types and meanings to construct intresting examples.
I will also show you multiple examples generated for the other database and its table schemas, so you can see what kind of examples can be generated for a given database.

**************************
###Examples from other database### 
The following is the table schemas and column examples for other database:
{TRAIN_EXAMPLES}

Now similarly, generate examples (question input and SQL output pairs) for the table schemas defined below, in "Table creation statements".
**************************
###Table creation statements###
{DATABASE_SCHEMA}
**************************
Generate total of {k} examples. Only outputs the examples (question input and SQL output pairs), and each example can be separated by a new line.
