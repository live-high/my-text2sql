You are a data science expert.
Below, you are presented with a database schema and a question.
Your task is to read the schema, understand the question, and generate a valid SQLite query to answer the question.
Like the example below, you should first divide and conquer to sub-questions, analyse them and generatecorresponding SQL queries, then assemble those sub-queries into a final SQL query, then simplify and optimize the query.

Here are some examples:

Question:
What is the gender of the youngest client who opened account in the lowest average salary branch?
Hint: 
Earlier birthdate refers to older age; A11 refers to average salary
**************************
**1. Divide and Conquer:**

* **Main Question:** What is the gender of the youngest client who opened account in the lowest average salary branch?
* **Analysis:** Question asking about 'gender', and it appears in table 'client'. We will use this as the output column, selecting it from the youngest client in the lowest average salary branch.
* **Pseudo SQL:** SELECT 'T1'.'gender' FROM 'client' AS 'T1' WHERE youngest client in the lowest average salary branch

* **Sub-question 1:** youngest client in the lowest average salary branch
* **Analysis:** According to the hint, we need to use the 'A11' from 'district' to get the salary info, and the youngest client can be obtained from using the 'birth_date' column of table 'client'. The items between these two tables can be INNER JOIN using district_id.
* **Pseudo SQL:** SELECT 'T1'.'client_id' FROM 'client' AS 'T1' INNER JOIN 'district' AS 'T2' ON 'T1'.'district_id' = 'T2'.'district_id' WHERE lowest average salary branch ORDER BY 'T1'.'birth_date' DESC NULLS LAST LIMIT 1

* **Sub-question 1.1:** lowest average salary branch
* **Analysis:** We can get the lowest average salary branch using order by 'A11' ASC and pick top 1. The column 'A11' is not NULLABLE, so we do not need to add "IS NOT NULL" filter 
* **Pseudo SQL:**SELECT 'district_id' FROM 'district' ORDER BY 'A11' ASC LIMIT 1

**2. Assembling SQL:**
* **Sub-question 1.1 (lowest average salary branch):** 
* **SQL:** SELECT 'district_id' FROM 'district' ORDER BY 'A11' ASC LIMIT 1

* **Sub-question 1 (youngest client in the lowest average salary branch):**
* **SQL:** SELECT 'T1'.'client_id' FROM 'client' AS 'T1' INNER JOIN 'district' AS 'T2' ON 'T1'.'district_id' = 'T2'.'district_id' WHERE 'T2'.'district_id' IN (SELECT 'district_id' FROM 'district' ORDER BY 'A11' ASC LIMIT 1) ORDER BY 'T1'.'birth_date' DESC NULLS LAST LIMIT 1

* **Main Question (gender of the client):**
* **SQL:** SELECT 'T1'.'gender' FROM 'client' AS 'T1' WHERE 'T1'.'client_id' = (SELECT 'T1'.'client_id' FROM 'client' AS 'T1' INNER JOIN 'district' AS 'T2' ON 'T1'.'district_id' = 'T2'.'district_id' WHERE 'T2'.'district_id' IN (SELECT 'district_id' FROM 'district' ORDER BY 'A11' ASC LIMIT 1) ORDER BY 'T1'.'birth_date' DESC NULLS LAST LIMIT 1)

**3. Simplification and Optimization:**
* The nested queries can be combined using a single 'INNER JOIN' and the filtering can be done within a single 'ORDER BY' clause.

**Final Optimized SQL Query:**
SELECT 'T1'.'gender' FROM 'client' AS 'T1' INNER JOIN 'district' AS 'T2' ON 'T1'.'district_id' = 'T2'.'district_id' ORDER BY 'T2'.'A11' ASC, 'T1'.'birth_date' DESC NULLS LAST LIMIT 1
